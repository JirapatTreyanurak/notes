## Philosophy

### Clustering-inspired decision making on thresholds
Consider when we make arbitrary decisions on certain thresholds, e.g. bad/neutral/good, 5 possible scores on a satisfactory scale, distinction of the opening/mid/end-game phases in Chess, allocations of roles in a team sport. Some of these may be the way they are due to historical reasons, and hence provide greater user experience. But this does not mean that they are optimal.  
Generalise the methods used in [determining the number of clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determining_the_number_of_clusters_in_a_data_set) to tackle these issues. And indeed, user experience may be one of the factor.

### On the infiniteness of multiverse
The assumption that a given conceivable event will occur in some multiverse does not follow from there being infinitely many multiverses. As a simple example to show that this implication does not hold in general, consider the interval `[0,1]`. Although this interval contains infinitely many real numbers, it does not contain every real numbers.

### Existence of a feasible set
When doing conceptual analysis, consider establishing the existence of a feasible set. It is non-trivial whether such a set exist even if we may be casually talking about the concept.

### Level of Concerns
Some may be concerned with things immediately around themselves; nearby people, and nearby events, both in the nearby time. Some may be concerned with things that are about one's nation. Some, the world and humankind. Some, our place in the universe.  
There is an inherent hierarchy, but to consider it an order of superiority is to take another epistemic step that one should be careful of.

### Attributions and Delegations
Attributing unfavourable events to unfavourable external situations or circumstances. Attributing favourable events to favourable internal traits or behaviours. Although the latter is fine in a sense that one can reinforce said behaviours, the former is left unchecked and the event probably repeated. Attributing events to fate is one such example. On the active end, attribution becomes delegation, and the external equivalent is to delegate one's action to hope.

### Argumentative Composure

### Intension Repositioning
When one ascribes to a behaviour in the past an intension different from what it originally was.
