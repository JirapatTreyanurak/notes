# Notes

## To Self
The triple A:  
 - **Appreciation**  
 To appreciate what you have and don't have. This enables you to do or not do things you may want or not want to do.
 - **Aspiration**  
 To aspire to be the best you can be no matter how big or small. This keeps you motivated and pushes you to progress.
 - **Attribution**  
 To attribute the goods and the bads on yourself to yourself. This allows you to change, to improve the goods and to lessen the bads.

## Philosophy

### Clustering-inspired decision making on thresholds
Consider when we make arbitrary decisions on certain thresholds, e.g. bad/neutral/good, 5 possible scores on a satisfactory scale, distinction of the opening/mid/end-game phases in Chess, allocations of roles in a team sport. Some of these may be the way they are due to historical reasons, and hence provide greater user experience. But this does not mean that they are optimal.  
Generalise the methods used in [determining the number of clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determining_the_number_of_clusters_in_a_data_set) to tackle these issues. And indeed, user experience may be one of the factor.

### On the infiniteness of multiverse
The assumption that a given conceivable event will occur in some multiverse does not follow from there being infinitely many multiverses. As a simple example to show that this implication does not hold in general, consider the interval `[0,1]`. Although this interval contains infinitely many real numbers, it does not contain every real numbers.

### Existence of a feasible set
When doing conceptual analysis, consider establishing the existence of a feasible set. It is non-trivial whether such a set exist even if we may be casually talking about the concept.

### Level of Concerns
Some may be concerned with things immediately around themselves; nearby people, and nearby events, both in the nearby time. Some may be concerned with things that are about one's nation. Some, the world and humankind. Some, our place in the universe.  
There is an inherent hierarchy, but to consider it an order of superiority is to take another epistemic step that one should be careful of.

### Attributions and Delegations
Attributing unfavourable events to unfavourable external situations or circumstances. Attributing favourable events to favourable internal traits or behaviours. Although the latter is fine in a sense that one can reinforce said behaviours, the former is left unchecked and the event probably repeated. Attributing events to fate is one such example. On the active end, attribution becomes delegation, and the external equivalent is to delegate one's action to hope.

### Constant Alternative
When comparing alternatives, the current option is often omitted when at times it can be relevant. 

### Argumentative Composure
One is argumentatively composed when one's argumentation is abstracted away from the delivery of the arguments. The delivery of an argument concerns who and how the argument is being presented; the feelings, desires, intentions, etc. accompanying the agent that is presenting the argument. Such things have no play in the validity of an argument (self-referential exceptions apply) and should therefore be *irrelevant* in a proper argumentation (whether or not they should be *present* is another question altogether; composure and argumentative composure are mutually exclusive).  
To demonstrate, one (composed or otherwise) wouldn't be *argumentatively composed* if one were to dismiss the argument sorely on the reason that the presenter is currently tempered (or sleepy, too happy, possesses records of bad arguments, not argumentatively composed, etc.). 

### Intension Repositioning
When one ascribes to a behaviour in the past an intension different from what it originally was.
